# Governance Committee
We believe the way forward is to establish a governance committee to support sound decision making and adherence to our mission. This committee will be called on to uncover blindspots, ensure adherence to sound business practices, and hold the board responsible for their promise to move us closer to our mission.
- Determine rules for organizers, events

## What do we expect from people on the governance committee?
- Review budgets, bylaws and code of conduct
- Oversee endeavors of other subcommittees to make sure the initiatives align WIAD mission
- Contribute at minimum 3 hours a month to attend quarterly meetings and contribute to discussions
